# translator-helper
This code utilizes ChatGPT to simplify and modernize a text to be used as an aid for translation. Input takes a Microsoft Word document and exports a Word document with the original text on the left and the modernized/simplified text on the right.

To run it, make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. Download this code, and add your ChatGPT API key to translator-helper.py

Then have your input.doc contain the text you want to modernize in perperation for translation in the same directory as translator-helper.py
